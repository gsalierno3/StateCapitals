The target user is anyone interested in learning state capitals and the two-letter state abbreviations.
Even though there are two sets of information, there are a total of 100 items to be learned.

The idea is to have the app select one of the 50 US states at random so a user can guess the state capital and the two-letter state abbreviation.

If the user is not able to guess on 5 trials, the system will provide the answer.

I was not born in the US and I came here as an adult.   This app will help me learn about state capitals and the two-letter state abbreviations.
